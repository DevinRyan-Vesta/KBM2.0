========================================
REFERENCE INFORMATION - FIXES APPLIED
========================================

1. CSRF TOKEN FIX
   Files Modified:
   - templates/base.html (line 7): Added CSRF meta tag
   - static/js/item_actions.js (lines 187-195): Added CSRF token to dynamic forms

   What was fixed:
   - All checkout, checkin, assign, and edit operations now include CSRF tokens
   - Prevents "Bad Request CSRF token is missing" errors

2. CONTACTS FIX
   Files Modified:
   - contacts/views.py (line 5): Added tenant_delete import

   What was fixed:
   - Can now link contacts to users
   - Can view contact details pages
   - Can delete contacts

3. DARK MODE UI FIXES
   Files Modified:
   - templates/base.html (lines 46-79): Added improved link styles
   - templates/keys.html: Fixed dropdown menu styles
   - templates/lockboxes.html: Fixed dropdown menu styles
   - templates/signs.html: Fixed dropdown menu styles

   What was fixed:
   - Export dropdowns now visible in dark mode (proper colors)
   - Links have better contrast and visibility
   - Visited links have distinct color (#ff6b9d in dark, #ad1457 in light)

4. RECEIPTS PAGE (READY TO APPLY)
   File to modify: inventory/views.py
   Location: After line 2096

   Add this code:
   ```python
   else:
       # Show 10 most recent receipts by default when no search query
       results = tenant_query(ItemCheckout).order_by(
           ItemCheckout.checked_out_at.desc()
       ).limit(10).all()
   ```

   This will make receipts page show 10 most recent receipts on first load.

Scripts Created (can be re-run if needed):
- fix_csrf_tokens.py
- fix_contacts.py
- fix_dark_mode_styles.py
- fix_receipts_default_view.py
